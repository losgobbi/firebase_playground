# firebase_playground

I've been developing a hybrid app for the last three years and this time I was using
the Firebase SaaS rather AWS. This applet allows me to test some Firestore security rules.

# What do we have here
A few samples for signUp, signIn and fetch some documents from the SaaS.

# Setup
- npm install firebase
- npm install ts-node

# How can I use this?
- Fill up credentials;
- Call the desired functions at the `do_test` placeholder;
- run: ts-node index.ts
